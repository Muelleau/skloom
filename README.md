## SkLoom

_pronunciation (es-kay-loom)_

SkLoom is a set of Scala classes providing Golang-like functionality
in Scala via Project Loom (https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/).
This includes Channels, Selectors, and Virtual Threads. The goal is a
to have an easy to use set of classes that make concurrency in Scala
as easy to use as its Golang equivalents.

We have included a Virtual Thread based implementation of Jetty server to demonstrate
usage of the library.
